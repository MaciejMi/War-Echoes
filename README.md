The project was created to practice using parameters and using the database.

## Run Locally

To run War Echoes, run this command on your git bash:

Linux and macOS:

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/MaciejMi/War-Echoes.git
```

Windows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaciejMi/War-Echoes.git
```

After that, you need to go to the node project directory, type

```bash
npm install
```

and then run the project by typing

```bash
 npm start
```

If there are any problems, enter:

```bash
node app.js
```

If you have done this, you need to import the database found in the file into your SQL Workbench. Finally, you need to create a password.json file in the utils folder and enter your database password there, e.g. {"password" : 123}
